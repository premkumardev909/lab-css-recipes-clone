          <h3>Directions</h3>
          <ol>
              <li>Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar, and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</li>
              <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.</li>
              <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350°F (175°C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
